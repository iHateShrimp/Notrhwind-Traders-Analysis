## Data Exploration: ##

> In the first part of the analysis, to gain some basic information about each table in a database, I do some simple queries such as the following:

### --1. List all product categories currently being distributed. ###
```sql
SELECT CategoryID, CategoryName, Description FROM [dbo].[Categories];
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/691425fc-5b37-43eb-bf21-a340bd52bf00)

### --2. Check the number of products by category ###
```sql
SELECT CategoryName, COUNT(ProductName) AS Number_of_Products
FROM [dbo].[Products] P
JOIN [dbo].[Categories] C
ON P.CategoryID = C.CategoryID
GROUP BY CategoryName
ORDER BY Number_of_Products;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e6b5c9e-0b0a-4279-adc1-bdfa32ef6a68)

From the two queries above, we can see that there are 8 categories, along with a description table for each category. The category "Produce" has the lowest number of products, with 5 products, while "Confections" has the highest, with 13 products.

### --3.  Check the Total Quantity of Products Still Distributed and Discontinued: ###

**Method 1: Declare two variables, with X representing the number of products currently being distributed and Y representing those discontinued. Discontinued is defined as 0 for currently distributed and 1 for discontinued.**
```sql
DECLARE @X INT, @Y INT 
SELECT @X = (SELECT COUNT(ProductName) FROM [dbo].[Products]
				WHERE Discontinued = 0),
		@Y = (SELECT COUNT(ProductName) FROM [dbo].[Products]
				WHERE Discontinued = 1)
PRINT @X;
PRINT @Y;
```
**Method 2: Using PIVOT and CASE WHEN to Create Crosstab-Reports.**
```sql
SELECT 
		COUNT(CASE Discontinued WHEN 0 THEN 1 END) AS Active_Product,
		COUNT(CASE Discontinued WHEN 1 THEN 1  END) AS Discontinued_Product 
FROM [dbo].[Products];
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc08f3a-9f9d-4e52-91ca-02f04cd68c5a)

Using DECLARE to assign variables and CASE WHEN in queries allows for easy classification of data based on specific conditions, improving reusability and simplifying complex calculations. This makes the query clearer, optimizes performance, and saves resources when processing data.

### --4. Total Quantity of Products Ordered: ###
```sql
SELECT COUNT(Quantity) AS Total_Ordered FROM [dbo].[Order Details];
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2cf947-56f3-42b7-ac29-8b52b0e1eca9)

### --5. Check the number of products by supplier ###
```sql
SELECT CompanyName, COUNT(ProductName) AS Number_of_Products
FROM [dbo].[Suppliers] S
JOIN [dbo].[Products] P 
ON S.SupplierID = P.SupplierID
GROUP BY CompanyName
ORDER BY Number_of_Products DESC;
```

### --6. List the Total Number of Orders by Country in Descending Order: ###
```sql
SELECT ShipCountry, COUNT(*) AS Orders_of_each_Country
FROM [dbo].[Orders]
GROUP BY ShipCountry
ORDER BY Orders_of_each_Country DESC;
```

**Conculsion:** Aiming to analyze product profitability, performing simple queries is crucial to gaining a preliminary understanding for more advanced queries. Northwind offers 8 product categories with a wide variety of products, including 69 active products and 8 discontinued ones. To date, 2,155 orders have been placed, with customers primarily located in North America, Europe, and some countries in South America. Among these, the USA and Germany lead the market with 122 orders each.

## --Advanced Analyze to answer questions: ##

> By analyzing the revenue of each category and product, we can assess their profitability potential, as well as their capacity to generate increased revenue over time, providing insights into the company's overall performance.

### --1.  Lists the top 10 products generating the highest net revenue, ordered in descending order: ###
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 D.ProductID, ProductName, SUM(Quantity * (D.UnitPrice - (Discount * D.UnitPrice))) AS Net_Value,
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(Quantity * (D.UnitPrice - (Discount * D.UnitPrice))) DESC) AS Ranking
FROM [dbo].[Order Details] D
JOIN [dbo].[Products] P
ON D.ProductID = P.ProductID
GROUP BY ProductName, D.ProductID;
```
In the first step of the revenue analysis, I list the top 10 products by revenue. However, I focus on net revenue, which is the revenue after deducting any discounts for each product. This approach provides a more accurate assessment of the actual profit generated by the revenue.

### --2.Which products have been discontinued (Discontinued = 1), and how much revenue have they generated? ###
```sql
SELECT D.ProductID, ProductName, SUM(Quantity * D.UnitPrice) AS Net_Value 
FROM [dbo].[Order Details] D
JOIN [dbo].[Products] P
ON D.ProductID = P.ProductID
WHERE Discontinued = 1
GROUP BY D.ProductID, ProductName
ORDER BY Net_Value DESC;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/286c063e-e62c-406a-9859-4ee1a0440768)

### --3. Identify the revenue for each quarter, compare the quarters across different years, and assess the differences between them: ###
```sql
WITH QuarterRevenue AS (
		SELECT	DATEPART(Year, O.OrderDate) AS Year, 
			DATEPART(Quarter, O.OrderDate) AS Quarter,
			SUM(D.UnitPrice * D.Quantity) AS Revenue 
			FROM [dbo].[Order Details] D

			JOIN [dbo].[Orders] O
			ON D.OrderID = O.OrderID

			GROUP BY DATEPART(Year, O.OrderDate), DATEPART(Quarter, O.OrderDate)
			);
SELECT *, LAG(Revenue) OVER(ORDER BY Year, Quarter) AS Previous_Revenue, Revenue - LAG(Revenue) OVER(ORDER BY Year, Quarter) AS Diff_Value FROM QuarterRevenue;
```

To solve the problem of comparing revenue between quarters, I divided it into two processing stages. Using CTE (Common Table Expressions) is very beneficial in this case, as it helps reduce query complexity and makes it easier to handle subsequent requests. We can easily use the "Revenue" column in the QuarterRevenue CTE for calculations in the LAG() function, instead of rewriting the revenue formula, which could make the query harder to understand.

### --4. List the total revenue and average revenue for each category: ###
```sql
SELECT	C.CategoryID, CategoryName, 
	SUM(D.UnitPrice * Quantity) AS Sum_of_Revenue,
	AVG(D.UnitPrice * Quantity) AS Avg_of_Revenue
FROM [dbo].[Order Details] D

JOIN [dbo].[Products] P
ON D.ProductID = P.ProductID

JOIN [dbo].[Categories] C
ON P.CategoryID = C.CategoryID

GROUP BY C.CategoryID, CategoryName;
```

> I explore key business insights by diving deep into product performance, seasonal trends, and customer purchasing behavior. Imagine you're managing inventory for a retail company and need to predict which product categories will dominate each quarter. By identifying top-selling items and tracking their revenue, we can uncover patterns that drive sales, allowing us to optimize stock levels, plan marketing strategies, and even target high-value customers more effectively. These insights not only sharpen decision-making but also boost profitability in a competitive market.

--5. Tìm ra trong từng quý của năm, đâu là category được chọn nhiều nhất, điều này sẽ tìm hiểu xu hướng tiêu dùng theo mùa, đâu là loại sản phẩm trong mùa cần lượng hàng nhiều nhất để đáp ứng như cầu của thị trường 
### --5. Which two categories were the most selected in each quarter of the year: ###
```sql
WITH CategorySelected AS (
			SELECT C.CategoryID, C.CategoryName, SUM(D.Quantity) AS Total_Products,
				DATEPART(Quarter, O.OrderDate) As Quarter,
				DATEPART(Year, O.OrderDate) AS Year
			FROM [dbo].[Categories] C
		
			JOIN [dbo].[Products] P
			ON C.CategoryID = P.CategoryID

			JOIN [dbo].[Order Details] D
			ON P.ProductID = D.ProductID

			JOIN [dbo].[Orders] O
			ON D.OrderID = O.OrderID

			GROUP BY C.CategoryID, C.CategoryName, DATEPART(Quarter, O.OrderDate), 				DATEPART(Year, O.OrderDate)
			),
RankedCategory AS (
		SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Year, Quarter
					ORDER BY Total_Products DESC) AS Ranked
		FROM CategorySelected
		);
----------
SELECT * FROM RankedCategory
WHERE Ranked <= 2;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e03430-27b8-48c0-8426-b55c236c3a1c)

We can see, the results show that Beverages and Dairy Products dominate as the most selected categories across multiple quarters, particularly in 1996 and 1997. However, by 1998, Seafood emerges as a key category. The highest product selection occurs for Dairy Products in 1998 Q1 with 2381 units. In the future, Seafood may continue gaining popluarity because it grew 1298 to 1968 in just 3 quarters.

### --6. Which are the top 3 products in each category with the highest revenue by quarter across the years: ###
```sql
WITH ProductRevenue AS (
		SELECT C.CategoryID, C.CategoryName, P.ProductName,
			DATEPART(Quarter, O.OrderDate) AS Quarter,
			DATEPART(Year, O.OrderDate) AS Year,
			SUM( D.UnitPrice * Quantity) AS Revenue
		FROM [dbo].[Order Details] D

		JOIN [dbo].[Products] P 
			ON D.ProductID = P.ProductID

		JOIN [dbo].[Categories] C
			ON P.CategoryID = C.CategoryID

		JOIN [dbo].[Orders] O 
			ON D.OrderID = O.OrderID
		GROUP BY C.CategoryID, C.CategoryName, P.ProductName, 
  			 DATEPART(Quarter, O.OrderDate), DATEPART(Year, O.OrderDate)
			),
RankedProducts AS (
		SELECT CategoryID, CategoryName, ProductName,
		Quarter, Year, Revenue,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY  CategoryID, Year, Quarter ORDER BY Revenue DESC) 				AS RANK 
		FROM ProductRevenue
			);

SELECT * FROM  RankedProducts
WHERE RANK <= 3;
```

### --7. Which are the top three most-ordered products for each category, along with the supplier information for those products: ###
```sql
WITH ProductRankings AS ( 
			SELECT  P.ProductID,
				P.ProductName,
				P.CategoryID,
				P.SupplierID,
				S.CompanyName,
				SUM(D.Quantity) AS Total_Orders,
				RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY P.CategoryID 									ORDER BY SUM(D.Quantity) DESC) AS ProductRank
			FROM [dbo].[Products] P

			JOIN [dbo].[Order Details] D
			ON P.ProductID = D.ProductID

			JOIN [dbo].[Orders] O
			ON D.OrderID = O.OrderID

			JOIN [dbo].[Suppliers] S
			ON P.SupplierID = S.SupplierID

			GROUP BY P.ProductID,
				 P.ProductName,
				 P.CategoryID,
				 P.SupplierID,
				 S.CompanyName
				);
							
SELECT * FROM ProductRankings
WHERE ProductRank <= 3;
```

### --8. Create a table to track inventory status, assess when items are out of stock, and update the stock levels daily: ###
```sql
--Create a VIEW with the Status of products labeled as "Out of Stock"
CREATE VIEW OutofStockStatus AS
SELECT * 
FROM (
    SELECT *, 
           CASE 
               WHEN UnitsInStock <= ReorderLevel AND UnitsOnOrder = 0 
                   THEN 'Out of Stock'
               ELSE 'Normal stock level'
           END AS Status 
    FROM [dbo].[Products]
    WHERE Discontinued = 0
) AS ProductView -- We need to name this subquery to consider it as a table
WHERE Status = 'Out of Stock';
--Run VIEW
SELECT * FROM OutofStockStatus;
```

To solve this problem, I use a VIEW() to create a table that regularly checks the stock status, evaluates when items are at a low stock warning level, and labels them as "Out of stock". Additionally, we only select values where Discontinued = 0, meaning we're focusing on products that are still active and available for sale, while ignoring those that have been discontinued. Creating a VIEW in this case helps us organize and process data more efficiently, reuse complex queries effectively, and ensure continuous updates without needing frequent changes when the original data changes.
